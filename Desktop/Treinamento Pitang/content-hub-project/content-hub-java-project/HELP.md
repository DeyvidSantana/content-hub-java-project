Content Hub Project
This is a final project pertaining to the training I participated in at Pitang. The Front-end is written in Angular and basically consists of a hub of content that has the function of storing information of movies, tv series and people. Roles of search, detail display, update and deletion of movies, tv series and people are part of the developed system.
